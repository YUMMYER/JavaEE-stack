## Hibernate

Before hibernate, developers used JDBC. However, with JDBC, there existed certain problems:

1. Checked exception code.

2. Memory leakage problem (Developer must open and close the connections).

3. Error code generated by JDBC technology

4. Implementation of boilerplate (Lots of duplicate codes)
